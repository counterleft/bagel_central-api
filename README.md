A HTTP API that tracks bagels given and received in foosball games. A bagel is given to the goalie of a team that loses a game of foosball without ever scoring a point.

This project is the backend portion extracted out of [winterchord/foosball-bagels], so that I can play with a 2-tier web app setup (front-/backend). The frontend will be an ember.js application. The intent of moving to a 2-tier setup is solely to experiment with frontend standalone js frameworks like ember.js, without having to conflate ember with rails in the same project.
